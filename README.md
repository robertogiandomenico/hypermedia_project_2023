## Usability Evaulation Review

This [_report_](https://github.com/InfantinoAndrea00/hypermedia_project_2023/blob/main/Usability%20Project/Giandomenico_Grimaldi_Infantino_Lamperti_UsabilityReport_16-04-2023.pdf) shows the usability evaluation of the website [_theinterngroup.com_](https://www.theinterngroup.com/).\
Usability evaluation aims at giving the client some clues to improve the productâ€™s quality and to fix possible issues.

## Web Technology Project

This is our website: [**Wizarding Ventures**](https://hypermedia-project-2023.vercel.app/).\
The purpose of the Web Technology Project is the development of a website for a Venture Capital.\
Should you see errors or the website does not load, probably it is caused by the free database host service of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) that deactivates itself after 1 week of disuse.

### Build Setup

To install the fundamental dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To open the website hosted locally at _localhost:3000_:

```
npm run dev -- -o
```

### Deliverables
